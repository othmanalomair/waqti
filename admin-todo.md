## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Add role column to creators table
ALTER TABLE creators ADD COLUMN role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'creator';
ALTER TABLE creators ADD CONSTRAINT creators_role_check 
    CHECK (role IN ('creator', 'admin', 'super_admin'));

-- Create admin analytics table
CREATE TABLE admin_analytics (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    page_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'landing', 'signin', 'signup'
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Route Structure
```
/admin                    - Admin dashboard (admin+ access)
/admin/users             - User management interface
/admin/users/create      - Create admin user form
/admin/users/:id         - User details/edit
/admin/analytics         - System analytics dashboard
/admin/workshops         - Workshop oversight
```

### Role Hierarchy
```
super_admin -> admin -> creator
- creator: Basic user access
- admin: User management + analytics
- super_admin: All admin features + admin user creation
```

## 🛡️ Security Features
- Role-based access control with middleware
- Session-based authentication (existing system)
- Protected admin user creation
- Password reset capabilities for admin users

## 📱 UI/UX Features
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Bilingual support (Arabic RTL / English LTR)
- Gulf-inspired color scheme consistency
- Touch-friendly interface
- HTMX for dynamic interactions

## 🔍 Admin Dashboard Features
- **User Statistics**: Total users, free vs paid, recent registrations
- **Workshop Analytics**: Total workshops, active workshops, enrollment stats
- **System Health**: Recent activity, pending orders, notifications
- **Traffic Analytics**: Landing page visits, signup conversions

## 🎛️ User Management Features
- View all users with pagination and search
- Edit user plans and subscription status
- Activate/deactivate user accounts
- Reset user passwords
- Create new admin users (super_admin only)
- View user details and activity

## ⚡ Next Steps
1. Start with database migration
2. Extend authentication middleware
3. Create admin handler and services
4. Build admin templates
5. Register and test routes

## 📝 Notes
- Maintain consistency with existing Waqti.me design patterns
- Use existing templ template system
- Leverage current authentication and session management
- Follow mobile-first development approach
- Ensure proper bilingual support throughout
